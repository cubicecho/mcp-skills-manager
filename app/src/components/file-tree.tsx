/**
 * A nested list of files and folders, as they sit on disk: folders first, each one a button that
 * folds what is under it, each file a link or a button. One source for both platforms.
 *
 * It is here because mcp-skills-manager drew a skill's files this way by hand — its own indent,
 * selected and hover colours, icon, monospace name and hover row actions on raw `<li>` and
 * `<button>` — and mcp-ragdown then copied it for its notes. Neither could fold a folder, because
 * that was not worth building for one app.
 *
 * What it settles, since the two copies disagreed or left it out:
 *
 * - **A folder folds.** Its row is one button with `aria-expanded` and a turning chevron, and what
 *   is under it is not mounted while it is shut. Every folder starts open, which is what both
 *   copies drew; `defaultOpen` starts it otherwise and `open`/`onOpenChange` hand it to the caller.
 * - **A file's row is a link or a button, never both.** `linkSlot` for an app whose open file is in
 *   the URL, `onSelect` for one that holds it in state. With neither, the row is only a row.
 * - **Row actions are siblings of the pressed part**, as `ListItem`'s are: a button in a button is
 *   invalid, and its click would also open the file. They are hidden until the row is hovered or
 *   holds focus only where there *is* a hover, so a touch screen is not left with buttons nobody
 *   can reach.
 * - **It is a list of lists, not a `role="tree"`.** Every row is reached with Tab and pressed with
 *   Enter or Space, which is what a list of links already does, and a tree role would promise
 *   arrow keys and typeahead on both platforms.
 *
 * The nesting is `buildTree`'s, which ships beside it in `@/lib/tree` for a caller that wants the
 * nodes without the look. A view with no folders to nest under — "recently changed" — is not a
 * tree: draw that one as a list of `ListItem`s.
